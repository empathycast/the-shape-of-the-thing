               all of us out here reacting<br>
               replaying patterns which we're <br>
               but through our actions we're enacting<br>
               the cage in which we're caught<br>
               <br>
               aversion to pain<br>
               is immediately plain<br>
               and desire for pleasure<br>
               is sought altogether<br>
               <br>
               but whether we recoil or embrace<br>
               is to thirst, and to give chase<br>
               it's to be swayed by outside events<br>
               to that which misleads and which prevents<br>
               <br>
               in reaction we are bound<br>
               to be foolish and fooling around<br>
               but consideration produces contentment<br>
               the path leading us from resentment<br>
               <br>
               there's a tale of two arrows that is told<br>
               the first is outside of your control<br>
               and if you pick it up, and shoot it again<br>
               you'll hit yourself, and suffer pain<br>
               <br>
               and so equanimity<br>
               is the means to have peace<br>
               to choose skillful action<br>
               and to release<br>
            </p>
