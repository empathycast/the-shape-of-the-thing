            <p>
               we make sense in the ways we're taught<br>
               we measure good by what is sought<br>
               gain and loss have status here<br>
               while contentment's for the queer<br>
               <br>
               desire for personal possessions and pleasures<br>
               desire to be known, and to be treasured<br>
               as if what matters is novelty and passion<br>
               like all that was good, follows from fashion<br>
               <br>
               "push away pain, sadness, and grief<br>
               from all that's unpleasant, seek your relief<br>
               simply ignore everything sad<br>
               strive to never feel anything bad"<br>
               <br>
               the yardstick used, is 'how do I feel'<br>
               but just for yourself do you consider the deal<br>
               that pleasure and pain are what we pursue<br>
               because we've lost sight of what makes goodness true<br>
               <br>
               when you solve for the first thing in your mind<br>
               you chase a phantom you'll never find<br>
               your goals become petty and mundane<br>
               and you end up restless, sour, and vain<br>
               <br>
               reality is as a stream<br>
               inundated by a torrent<br>
               and you can't make satisfaction<br>
               while fighting the current<br>
            </p>
