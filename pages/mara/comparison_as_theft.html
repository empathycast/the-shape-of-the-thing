               that what you have you could enjoy<br>
               but to compare is to destroy<br>
               to dwell on what your neighbour's got<br>
               will make you feel as though you ought<br>
               <br>
               having less induces envy<br>
               as you compare to those with more<br>
               it's hard and harder to be friendly<br>
               being bitter, feeling sore<br>
               <br>
               and if you've a preponderance<br>
               look downward in your pride<br>
               to stand above and look askance<br>
               still will leave you tied<br>
               <br>
               all us out here measuring<br>
               what we have and what we don't<br>
               lead us to endeavouring<br>
               after what we won't<br>
               <br>
               when you're stuck judging<br>
               what's made is begrudging<br>
               missing out on being<br>
               and wanting, never seeing<br>
               <br>
               that you stole from yourself<br>
               what you could have had<br>
               peace, presence, and solace<br>
               and to be quietly glad<br>
            </p>
