               <p>
                   the god of desire and deceit<br>
                   mara mara mara<br>
                   the god of delusion and self-conceit<br>
                   who makes and remakes samsara<br>
                   <br>
                   he sells avoidance and attachment<br>
                   to feel good and never bad<br>
                   that you feel detachment<br>
                   and for yourself are always glad<br>
                   <br>
                   as a means of worship<br>
                   we keep tightly shut our eyes<br>
                   reacting to what happens<br>
                   without seeing the lies<br>
                   <br>
                   mara questions what you've got<br>
                   and says look over at your neighbour<br>
                   that what's right, is to have more<br>
                   to be seen and held as greater<br>
                   <br>
                   his chord is desire and discontentment<br>
                   that you shall be insatiable<br>
                   to feel primarily resentment<br>
                   for what's unobtainable<br>
                   <br>
                   and so he says protect your peace<br>
                   it's good and right and true<br>
                   "let your care for others lapse and cease<br>
                   what do they care for you?"<br>
                   <br>
                   uphold yourself in the highest<br>
                   as the first and last thing here<br>
                   exalt in your bias<br>
                   as if self were all that's dear<br>
                   <br>
                   mara the beguiler<br>
                   who shall remain unseen<br>
                   for as long as this defiler<br>
                   succeeds in his smokescreen<br>
               </p>
