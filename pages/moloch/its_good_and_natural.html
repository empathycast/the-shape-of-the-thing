            <p>
               "it's good and natural, this thing that we have built<br>
               and as you step on others, you should feel no guilt<br>
               for those who're getting trampled, it may seem unfair<br>
               but everyone is trampling here, it's not for you to care"<br>
               <br>
               ours is a hierarchy of power<br>
               and insecurity of place<br>
               either you'll ascend the tower<br>
               or fail to keep the pace<br>
               <br>
               this is how it's always been<br>
               the fittest will survive<br>
               "it's not through cooperation<br>
               but through strength that you may thrive"<br>
               <br>
               the robber barons keep on telling<br>
               it's inevitable and just<br>
               yet all the while they're selling<br>
               us a deeply sown distrust<br>
               <br>
               we make our jungle laws, to eat each other up<br>
               justifications made to drink down another's cup<br>
               <br>
               in our alleged meritocracy<br>
               we get exactly what we're owed<br>
               but the landed aristocracy<br>
               sit back and reap what we have sowed<br>
               <br>
               so as you struggle to survive in this system of ours<br>
               what doesn't kill you, leaves you covered in scars<br>
               it ain't natural or good, for us to compete<br>
               we were made for each other, to share what's replete<br>
