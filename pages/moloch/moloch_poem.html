            <p>
               our god who whispers and divides bears the name moloch<br>
               and his offered purpose is to despoil human stock<br>
               moloch the god of competition, ruin, and sacrifice<br>
               asks "what's the least you'd take, for your own bride price?"<br>
               <br>
               moloch is the official, who oversees the race<br>
               the prison guard proffering preferential place<br>
               <br>
               selling us a story, with zero summation<br>
               we compete with each other, to raise our own station<br>
               <br>
               that scarcity is carved into social stone<br>
               "fight" says moloch, "or starve alone"<br>
               the law of the jungle is eat or be ate<br>
               it's natural and good, if you want to be great<br>
               <br>
               so in our squabbling, scrambling, sordid fight<br>
               we've no one to turn to, to make things right<br>
               what once was whole, we have forsaken<br>
               the thing that was shared, we no longer partake in<br>
               <br>
               we line ourselves up, in order of power descending<br>
               to kneel at the altar of he who's pretending<br>
               some must rise, and some must fall<br>
               for moloch to fly, we must crawl<br>
               <br>
               our great dilemma<br>
               is to share or to hoard<br>
               but it's hard to be generous<br>
               when all you know is the sword<br>
               <br>
               he endlessly hungers, and cannot be sated<br>
               moloch shops around what you have donated<br>
               in a race to the bottom, of what we hold dear<br>
               everything is demanded, and we pay it in fear<br>
               <br>
               power concedes nothing, without demand<br>
               moloch will not free us, 'til we force his hand<br>
            </p>
