            <p>
               this is the place where people freeze<br>
               and children hunger with unmet pleas<br>
               the baseline is to be without<br>
               to be uneasy and feel doubt<br>
               <br>
               resources are scarce this you will know<br>
               because our law and lobbies make them so<br>
               privatized and deregulated<br>
               access for some while the rest are unsated<br>
               <br>
               "well unemployment is good actually<br>
               to keep the poors from their laxity"<br>
               <br>
               is housing a human need?<br>
               or is it a tool for human greed?<br>
               as long as a house is an asset class<br>
               people will live under the overpass<br>
               <br>
               money is used to speculate<br>
               to control the supply and increase the rate<br>
               <br>
               it's hard to see others with your head under water<br>
               it's hard to care when you hear of the slaughter<br>
               our power is broken, and we're disconnected<br>
               our nose to the grindstone, keeps us subjected<br>
               <br>
               this has been the way of things<br>
               for as long as we been writing<br>
               that wealth accrues from scarcity<br>
               by keeping us infighting<br>
               <br>
               well scarcity's made by middlemen<br>
               who scoop up our goods, to sell back again<br>
               so let's change the rules, and fix our plight<br>
               access for all is what's ours by right<br>
