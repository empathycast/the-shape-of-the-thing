               "hustle, hunger, rise and grind<br>
               no room to care, or to be kind<br>
               your purpose is to labour here<br>
               to create wealth, not volunteer"<br>
               <br>
               as we kneel at the altar we've made for moloch<br>
               we offer up kindness to his chopping block<br>
               to care in this place, is maladaptive<br>
               this is how we've come to be captive<br>
               <br>
               volunteer work is unvalued labour<br>
               because you provide it for free to your neighbour<br>
               a thing freely given is a thing freely got<br>
               if you ain't make profit, you ain't made naught<br>
               <br>
               if you're worried about coming up with the rent<br>
               then doing for others is labour misspent<br>
               and if you've got more wealth, than you've got needs<br>
               protecting your pile's your primary deed<br>
               <br>
               in our sink or swim society<br>
               division comes from anxiety<br>
               real community is a far off dream<br>
               precluded by our needful schemes<br>
               <br>
               when you sacrifice care on the altar of self<br>
               to gain an edge, and make your wealth<br>
               you offer up too, what you could have received<br>
               love and kindness for when you're aggrieved<br>
