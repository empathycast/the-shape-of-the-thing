            <p>
               I hold values and beliefs<br>
               as any person does<br>
               these are founded on my griefs<br>
               and built from and for a cause<br>
               <br>
               they did not come from a person's mouth<br>
               nor were they written in a book<br>
               but were divined with sight<br>
               for those who care to look<br>
               <br>
               held as foundation stones<br>
               noted known and true<br>
               felt deep within my bones<br>
               as knowledge I construe<br>
               <br>
               held beyond proof or demonstration<br>
               held before attestation<br>
               that it shall be innately known<br>
               and held as a true touchstone<br>
               <br>
               upon these I build my house<br>
               and make meaning by their measure<br>
               I accept them without doubts<br>
               what when why whichever<br>
            </p>
