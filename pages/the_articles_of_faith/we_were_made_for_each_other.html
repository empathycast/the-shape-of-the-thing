            <p>
               we are social creatures<br>
               with innate appetites<br>
               among our defining features<br>
               is to be seen in other's sights<br>
               <br>
               our pleasures and pains<br>
               are personally known<br>
               and refusal to see others<br>
               will keep you alone<br>
               <br>
               being centered and receiving care<br>
               feels good, and feels fair<br>
               giving kindness and holding grace<br>
               feels good, like an embrace<br>
               <br>
               we were made to build<br>
               our great house together<br>
               our promise fulfilled<br>
               shelters us from the weather<br>
               <br>
               our needs and abilities are intertwined<br>
               to give and receive, what we have in kind<br>
               my friends, for this, we were made<br>
               to join hands in our parade<br>
            </p>
