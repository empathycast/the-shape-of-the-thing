            <p>
               this is what's allotted<br>
               for men who seek to pass<br>
               the traits and expectations<br>
               granted to our class<br>
               <br>
               women are not granted these<br>
               but live them all the same<br>
               allowed our affectations<br>
               long as they play the game<br>
               <br>
               strength is the essential thing<br>
               set before the rest<br>
               next your independence<br>
               by which you're self-possessed<br>
               <br>
               assertive of yourself<br>
               up to and past aggression<br>
               ours is not to make<br>
               even minor concessions<br>
               <br>
               sexual appetite <br>
               is the connectedness allowed<br>
               though it's more a numbers game <br>
               of which you can be proud<br>
               <br>
               be stoic in your temperament<br>
               ignore any pains<br>
               do not dwell on what you feel<br>
               focus on your gains<br>
               <br>
               granted rationality<br>
               and distance from emotion<br>
               it's to our absent god we pray<br>
               with anger as devotion<br>
               <br>
               leadership is ours<br>
               and so is to provide<br>
               a holdover from times<br>
               when women were denied<br>
               <br>
               all those other things<br>
               that a human person feels<br>
               you're not granted these<br>
               so deny your own appeals<br>
            </p>
