            <p>
               what is a man, what makes him so<br>
               who gets respect that we bestow?<br>
               <br>
               what are the borders and their ends<br>
               how are we classifying men?<br>
               with these people and in this place<br>
               a man is a specific case<br>
               <br>
               not a human person<br>
               with a set of human needs<br>
               not a thing of love<br>
               but a thing of acts and deeds <br>
               <br>
               man is a set of expectations<br>
               we receive as patrimony<br>
               an image and an accusation<br>
               the obligation is boloney<br>
               <br>
               manhood is not granted<br>
               by your rights of birth<br>
               it's the pressures planted<br>
               suggestions of your worth<br>
               <br>
               the measure by which you pass or fail<br>
               perform or be prejudged<br>
               act in the play, or be excluded<br>
               no middle way is trudged<br>
               <br>
               manhood is conferred<br>
               by the respect of other men<br>
               and it must be reasserted<br>
               again and again<br>
               <br>
               to be a man, and to be granted<br>
               the privileges allotted<br>
               participate as if it were<br>
               injustice was unspotted<br>
               <br>
               what is a man, what makes us so?<br>
               the simple display of a man-show<br>
