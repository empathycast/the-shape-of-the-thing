            <p>
               if the realm of men you'll claim<br>
               then your obliged to play the game<br>
               <br>
               teasing, joking, jostling, fights<br>
               climbing the ranks in endless rites<br>
               raise yourself, above your peers<br>
               compare wealth and your careers<br>
               <br>
               all the men play, no one's exempt<br>
               no time outs granted, no safe attempt<br>
               it starts with your peers or begins with your dad<br>
               it ends when you die, no escape to be had<br>
               <br>
               no girls allowed, this is for the boys<br>
               our game of status, and endless poise<br>
               played against men, and judged by them too<br>
               respect is the prize which we try to accrue<br>
               <br>
               it's won and lost in ten thousand ways<br>
               in every action, in all your displays<br>
               <br>
               how well do you perform the role?<br>
               how well do you police it?<br>
               dominance here is the goal<br>
               to be meek makes you unfit<br>
               <br>
               what happens to players who never can rest<br>
               tiptoeing around an unending test?<br>
               to always be guarded, to never relent<br>
               to seek someone smaller whom you can torment<br>
               <br>
               comply and conform, or you will be shamed<br>
               there can be no trust among those who are maimed<br>
               without a safe place, to let down your guard<br>
               you walk 'round the world, feathered and tarred<br>
               <br>
               this is the game we're compelled to play<br>
               how we make manhood, and how we betray<br>
