            <p>
               you were born a human person<br>
               naive to the world<br>
               ignorant of just exactly<br>
               where you had been hurled<br>
               <br>
               eyes open to your parents<br>
               eyes open to your peers<br>
               taught difference between boys and girls<br>
               with so many jeers<br>
               <br>
               be a big boy<br>
               showing strength and ability<br>
               abandon care<br>
               and with it fragility<br>
               <br>
               don't act like a girl<br>
               you'll be called a slur<br>
               what could be worse<br>
               than an effete poseur<br>
               <br>
               the whispers and the yelling<br>
               the pressures that you face<br>
               abide or be derided<br>
               in here there is no grace<br>
               <br>
               the ways and means your dad was taught<br>
               is what he passed to you<br>
               the gaze and dreams that you have bought<br>
               is what you're teaching too<br>
               <br>
               one is not born a man<br>
               for the men here are made<br>
               not here as we began<br>
               but how we have been played<br>
