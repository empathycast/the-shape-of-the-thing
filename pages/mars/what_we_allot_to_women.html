            <p>
               the times they are a changing<br>
               as women change their lot<br>
               and with much rearranging<br>
               some freedoms have been wrought<br>
               <br>
               what we permit to women<br>
               we make shameful to men<br>
               if you will embody these<br>
               you'll be judged feminine<br>
               <br>
               women are our nurturers<br>
               this is what we expect<br>
               to provide us care and comfort<br>
               and to genuflect<br>
               <br>
               have empathy and deference<br>
               is what they are told<br>
               be the bigger person<br>
               even when you're getting sold<br>
               <br>
               regarding chastity<br>
               this is a made up standard<br>
               and so women having sex<br>
               does not make them slandered<br>
               <br>
               granted sensitivity<br>
               to show weakness when you're weak<br>
               to be as soft as you feel<br>
               without hearing critique<br>
               <br>
               emotional expression<br>
               to speak the thing your feeling<br>
               though it's cast as weakness<br>
               at least you're not concealing<br>
               <br>
               submission and support<br>
               the roles women are taught<br>
               binary division<br>
               is what creates our gender knot<br>
               <br>
               and so the lines are drawn<br>
               our experiences preordained<br>
               but we each have agency<br>
               so live it unconstrained<br>
