               the gravity of gender<br>
               how does it get its weight?<br>
               what is so important here?<br>
               why does it feel innate?<br>
               <br>
               gender is personal and uniquely known<br>
               a function of self, in a social place<br>
               the roots of the thing are deeply sown<br>
               though how it grows is face to face<br>
               <br>
               we're normal people, with normal desires<br>
               to be seen, to be included, and to be esteemed<br>
               the models we hold up, act as justifiers<br>
               demonstrating how, masculinity is deemed<br>
               <br>
               we are measured on a curve<br>
               each against another<br>
               and if it is you will not serve<br>
               you won't be titled brother<br>
               <br>
               and those who fail the measure of man<br>
               are cast from the fire to the frying pan<br>
               without even the glow of competitive regard<br>
               ashamed and alone, out in the yard<br>
               <br>
               if you've been snubbed<br>
               and wish for affirmation<br>
               you're left to comply<br>
               and make peace with predation<br>
               <br>
               manhood has a type and scope<br>
               a definition here<br>
               participation is required<br>
               or you'll be cast as queer<br>
            </p>
