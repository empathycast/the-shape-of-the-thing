               the bespoke god of man we've made<br>
               goes by the name of mars<br>
               and his consuming hunger<br>
               demands offerings of ours<br>
               <br>
               mars the god of man<br>
               of virility and war<br>
               mars who does demand<br>
               that an oath to him be swore<br>
               <br>
               the patriarch<br>
               and the provider<br>
               our warlord king<br>
               who does preside here<br>
               <br>
               mars who plays pretend<br>
               to a platonic form<br>
               but who is created<br>
               as we offer up our norms<br>
               <br>
               only a god in so far<br>
               as he's got us believing<br>
               there's one way to appear<br>
               to be seen as achieving<br>
               <br>
               his power is made<br>
               in the social domain<br>
               as we tithe to him<br>
               our care and our pain<br>
               <br>
               men enter to his congregation<br>
               with selfish acts of mutilation<br>
               of those who kneel, and those who resist<br>
               we break on the wheel, or simply desist<br>
               <br>
               this old man has had his time<br>
               and now his time is done<br>
               he's ours to grant or to decline<br>
               to make into someone<br>
            </p>
