            <p>
               be a man they say<br>
               with everything implicit<br>
               the esteem of other men<br>
               is the thing that we solicit<br>
               <br>
               it's our performance<br>
               and the acts we display<br>
               this ain't anything other<br>
               than gendered roleplay<br>
               <br>
               it is men<br>
               we're the deciders<br>
               on who's raised up<br>
               we're the dividers<br>
               <br>
               you wear the mask<br>
               you play the part<br>
               craft a facade<br>
               silence your heart<br>
               <br>
               and as you perform the role you're given<br>
               mimicking men and myth and might<br>
               the mistakes you make are unforgiven<br>
               your social crimes mark you as slight<br>
               <br>
               it's our gaze that decides<br>
               as you're measured and assessed<br>
               it's our game that provides<br>
               the unending test<br>
               <br>
               the acceptance we strive for<br>
               is a fickle thing<br>
               we're always at risk<br>
               of being made second string<br>
               <br>
               it cannot be held<br>
               there's no way to be done<br>
               the mask that you make<br>
               will become someone<br>
            </p>
