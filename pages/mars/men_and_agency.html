               sexual assault<br>
               is a pervasive problem here<br>
               with mental somersaults<br>
               we ask was the clothing sheer?<br>
               <br>
               "I couldn't help myself<br>
               did you see how she was dressed?<br>
               if women leave the house like that<br>
               they deserve the rest"<br>
               <br>
               men are not simple automata<br>
               operating by instinct<br>
               we have agency to act and choose<br>
               what we think and do are linked<br>
               <br>
               a rapist rapes because<br>
               they do not see another person<br>
               not because of hormones<br>
               but because of their perversion<br>
               <br>
               casting men as predators<br>
               slavering over prey<br>
               sets tone for what's acceptable<br>
               and leads us to downplay<br>
               <br>
               if we excuse the acts of men<br>
               as biologically compelled<br>
               we teach women that from us<br>
               trust must be withheld<br>
               <br>
               under such a system<br>
               it cannot be asked<br>
               "why are women so choosy<br>
               why are men typecast?"<br>
               <br>
               to be a male victim<br>
               within a place as this<br>
               is to be party to<br>
               the women we dismiss<br>
               <br>
               our worship of power<br>
               paints victims as faulted<br>
               but it's shameful to assault<br>
               not to be assaulted<br>
               <br>
               men are human people<br>
               with normal human volition<br>
               if we are denied this<br>
               we'll behave without contrition<br>
               <br>
               we're regular people<br>
               we do as we decide<br>
               in your autonomy<br>
               please have some pride<br>
            </p>
