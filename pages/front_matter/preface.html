               so what, why, and wherefore<br>
               poems written to restore<br>
               these were set down to elucidate<br>
               the cage around we see as fate<br>
               <br>
               to explain to you<br>
               what's plain to me<br>
               to take my truths<br>
               and set them free<br>
               <br>
               that we create our gods as culture<br>
               and understand them as immutable<br>
               that while we worship, they endure<br>
               but in our remaking they're refutable<br>
               <br>
               mars, moloch, mammon, and mara<br>
               with whose worship we remake gomorrah<br>
               that they make real bitter hatred<br>
               that they pervert what should be sacred<br>
               <br>
               the purpose here is heresy<br>
               of our corrupted pantheon<br>
               that we remake with clarity<br>
               and usher here a bright new dawn<br>
               <br>
               this was written for those who can read<br>
               for those with hearts that weep and bleed<br>
               bound together with silver string<br>
               this was written for all who sing
