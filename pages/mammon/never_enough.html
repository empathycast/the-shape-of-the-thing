            <p>
               chasing greed and growth and grandeur<br>
               as a dog chases after cars<br>
               to pursue is de rigueur<br>
               to sit is a faux pax<br>
               <br>
               that you may create success here<br>
               making money money money<br>
               but contentment won't appear<br>
               for you've been played a fool honey<br>
               <br>
               after making wealth absolute<br>
               you chase wealth comparative<br>
               looking at your neighbors in pursuit<br>
               and making more as your imperative<br>
               <br>
               money is power to affect<br>
               once you've got it, concern is to protect<br>
               your riches, luxury, and your lifestyle<br>
               anxious to control and to guard your pile<br>
               <br>
               those who've attained money and success<br>
               set themselves apart from us plebs<br>
               seeing struggle as our just redress<br>
               for failure to produce proceeds<br>
               <br>
               fears are transformed from food and shelter<br>
               into loss of status held<br>
               once you've money enough accrued<br>
               fear becomes of being excelled<br>
               <br>
               and so the rich leave libraries<br>
               endowments and bequests<br>
               and each of these their name carries<br>
               to whitewash their conquests<br>
               <br>
               that there can never be enough<br>
               for those with rapacious hunger<br>
               the call of wealth you must rebuff<br>
               or die chasing a number<br>
