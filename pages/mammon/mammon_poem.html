            <p>
               the gleaming golden god of greed<br>
               is worshipped as mammon<br>
               we fill ourselves on currency<br>
               and suffer from famine<br>
               <br>
               we have here insecurity<br>
               for our material conditions<br>
               desire is for surety<br>
               and secure positions<br>
               <br>
               to make comfort and be safe<br>
               money is what you need<br>
               if you wish relief from strife<br>
               then chase mammon and plead<br>
               <br>
               so profit is exalted<br>
               and held as what makes good<br>
               its blinding light defaulted<br>
               washing out our personhood<br>
               <br>
               "greed is good and right and true"<br>
               mammon drips in your ear<br>
               "everyone else is doing it<br>
               why should you be austere?"<br>
               <br>
               and for the acolytes<br>
               who succeed in their riches<br>
               human good recedes<br>
               replaced with golden itches<br>
               <br>
               there can never be enough<br>
               mammon is never sated<br>
               even after you've been stuffed<br>
               your hunger's not abated<br>
               <br>
               mammon is the measure<br>
               by which you succeed<br>
               for him there's nothing else to this<br>
               but your consuming greed<br>
            </p>
