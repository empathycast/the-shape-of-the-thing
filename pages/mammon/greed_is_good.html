            <p>
               there is some jibber jabber<br>
               about selfish genes<br>
               where goodness comes from solving<br>
               how to maximize your means<br>
               <br>
               hierarchy is good<br>
               and it's natural to compete<br>
               so sayeth the man<br>
               who profits from your time sheet<br>
               <br>
               the conniver milton friedman<br>
               says some shit about tides and boats<br>
               appealing to your greed when<br>
               he tells you everybody floats<br>
               <br>
               a meritocracy is when<br>
               rewards are allotted by merit<br>
               but in this place that we have built<br>
               the distribution's more disparate<br>
               <br>
               we're supposed to be incentivized<br>
               with gleaming prospects in our eyes<br>
               but to conflate the good as greedy<br>
               is to denigrate the needy<br>
               <br>
               philanthropy gets bandied about<br>
               as proof that greed produces more than wealth<br>
               but if it's good to help and be helped<br>
               shouldn't you solve for something other than self?<br>
               <br>
               the lie that's being told<br>
               is that greed is good<br>
               that gathering your gold<br>
               lifts up the neighborhood<br>
