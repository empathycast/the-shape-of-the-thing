         <p>
            let me try again<br>
            to uncynically be seen<br>
            to speak to you as though<br>
            it could have ever been<br>
            <br>
            when I was a child<br>
            I took a look around<br>
            and saw that everybody<br>
            suffered the same frown<br>
            <br>
            when I was told to smile<br>
            while feeling deeply sad<br>
            I made a separation<br>
            of in and outer halves<br>
            <br>
            and this thing without<br>
            that walks around with you<br>
            was faked until 'twas made<br>
            a simulacrum grew<br>
            <br>
            all the while the one within<br>
            sublimated into ether<br>
            until there was nothing left<br>
            but a bare perceiver<br>
            <br>
            we continue to persist<br>
            the monster and the silence<br>
            each a discrete half<br>
            bound in our defiance<br>
         </p>
